# Description
A python program that will create a simple calculator. This program will allow the user to choose what operation (addition, subtraction, multilication, division) they want to perform. 

# How to run the program
  1. To run the program, the user will be asked for the operation between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  2. The user will be asked again to input two integers, and then the program will execute them.
  3. The output will be displayed.
  4. After that, the user will be asked again if they want to continue solving equations. If yes, then the program will continue, and if no, the program will exit.
  5. Using try and except ValueError in exception handling, if the input value is incorrect, the program will display "Error: Invalid input" and "Try Again". The  program will automatically ask the user again for the operation.
  6. Using try and except ZeroDivisionError in exception handling, if the input integer is divided by zero, then the program will display "Error: You cannot divide by zero" and "Try Again". The program will automatically ask the user again for the operation.
  7. Otherwise, if the user inputs the wrong operation, the program will display "Invalid Operation" and "Try Again". The program will automatically ask the user again for the operation.

# Program
The program will look like this:
